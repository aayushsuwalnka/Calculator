📘 Advanced Calculator (DSA-Based)
Developed During 15-Day Summer Training — Anand International College of Engineering

Author: Aayush Suwalnka (College ID: 24cs001)

📌 Overview

This project is an Advanced Calculator built using the concepts I learned during my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) summer training.
The calculator is designed to handle not only basic arithmetic operations but also advanced functionalities, applying DSA concepts like stacks, queues, linked lists, recursion, and expression evaluation.

This project served as a foundational exercise to strengthen my understanding of implementing real-world applications using DSA.

✨ Features

✔ Basic operations — Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
✔ Advanced operations — Power, Factorial, Modulus
✔ Expression Evaluation using Stacks
✔ Menu-driven program with clean structure
✔ Modular code design
✔ Error handling for invalid inputs

🧠 DSA Concepts Used

Stacks → Expression evaluation (Infix to Postfix, Postfix evaluation)

Linked Lists → Dynamic data handling

Recursion → Implementing operations like factorial and power

Queues → Structured operation flow (if implemented)

Modular Functions → For clean readability and maintainability
